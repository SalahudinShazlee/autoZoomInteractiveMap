This is an auto zoom interactive map which the backend is written in javascript and jquery and the frontend in html and CSS. This personal project is an offshoot of JQVMap. The map zooms in on to the location on land where the cursor is and can be updated to hyperlink to any page for any specific country,as can be extrapolated from viewing the src of the worldLabelZoom.html file.

To test the map simply open worldLabelZoom.html with a browser of your choice
